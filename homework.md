> - Why i need multiple route handler ? Answer :- Middleware
<br> // GET /user => Middleware Chain => Request Handler
> - **What is Middleware?**
<br> At its core, middleware in Express.js refers to functions that execute during the lifecycle of a request to a web server. These functions can modify the request and response objects (req, res), and either terminate the request-response cycle or pass control to the next middleware function. <br> 
 **Why Do We Need it?** <br>
Middleware functions can be used for various tasks like logging, authentication, error handling, and more.<br>
In simpler terms, middleware acts as a bridge between the incoming request from the client and the final response from the server.
